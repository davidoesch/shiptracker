# shiptracker
ShipTracker is a Python and JavaScript-based application for visualizing real-time and historical ship positions, tracks, and weather data. It collects AIS position reports, enriches them with weather information from Open-Meteo, and displays ship tracks and live status on an interactive Leaflet map.
